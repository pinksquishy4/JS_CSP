//What is the difference between an integer and a float in C?
//an interger takes whole numbers, and a float takes decimals. Doubles have to be decimals.

//How does C handle integer division compared to float division?
//all division is integer division, unless one of your numbers is a float...it will always return an integer. Even if it is division.

//List the arithmetic operators available in C and their functions.
/* +-- division
- -- subtraction
/ -- divison 
*-- multiplication
%-- modulo (Remainder)
*/

//What is the modulus operator, and how is it used?


//How do you round a float to the nearest integer in C?


//What is type casting in C? Provide an example of explicit type casting.
//Where we detirmine what the data type is and you change that datta type by doing explixet casting
//printf("8/3 = %f\n", (float)8/3);
//cast is specifically stating the data type 

//How do compound assignment operators work in C? List three examples.


//what is the purpose of the math.h library? Name three functions it provides.



//How do you print a float with a specific number of decimal places using printf()?



//What happens when you mix integer and float operations in C?
//the outcome will always be a float,, just like in python
